All practice tests in Canvas also include some video tutorials. Once you have completed the chapter homework with a minimum of 80%, you will be able to take the test. All tests must be taken, in order, to move on to the next test. All tests have deadlines but can be taken early. See Canvas for an Honorlock tutorial and how to set up the program. A webcam will be required.     You must have photo identification (LCC student ID, or driver's license) with you when you log in to Honorlock.      Access Honorlock through Canvas on the test page. You can find this in modules for that unit. You must complete the exam in one sitting. Turn in all scratch paper in Canvas within 10 minutes of completing your exam. Show all of your work on your scratch paper or you might be asked to meet with your instructor to discuss the missing work. Label it clearly so you can get partial credit for good work even if the final answer is incorrect! Scratch paper is REQUIRED to be turned in. A test grade will not be submitted in Canvas without scratch paper. The scratch should show the steps for a problem. If there are no steps shown on problems that require steps, you might be asked to a video conference to discuss the results.      There will be no cell phone use for any reason. Put your phone away! Any use of electronic devices will be considered cheating. Honorlock will flag any suspicious behaviour and then I have to go back and watch your exam.

Optical characterization of Semiconductors (20 points) (a) A semiconductor is illuminated with a red light with a wavelength of 633 nm. We observe some infrared light emission with a peak wavelength of 750 nm. What information about the emitted light can be used to determine if the light emitted is the Stokes line from Raman scattering or is actually photoluminescence? You could propose additional experiments to guide your determination; but if you do, please describe what experiments will be conducted and how results from such experiments will be used to make the determination. (10 points) (b) A particular semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 2.2 eV contains a certain type of point defects with a concentration of 10 ppm. These point defects have a Gaussian distribution in energy with the peak at 300 meV below the conduction band and a peak width of 100 meV.  Discuss how the presence of these point defects may impact the optical absorption and luminescence spectra (i.e. how the absorption and luminescence spectra of this defect-containing semiconductor may be different from those of the same semiconductor without these defects).

      "Open the Quiz 5 Student Answer File (Excel File). Follow these instructions to complete your quiz. Historical income statements and balance sheets for Carl's Soup Co. are provided in the above referenced Excel file. All dollar figures and share values are expressed in millions of dollars.    In the Worksheet named \"Historical & Pro Forma,\" identify all the numbers in Tables 1 and 2 that should be calculated based on other numbers and replace these numbers with the appropriate formulas. (10 points)  Additionally, calculate the historical earnings per share (EPS) and Dividends per share (DPS) in rows 31 and 32. (5 points)   Pro Forma Statements (Unbalanced).You have been asked to prepare projected financial statements for Carl's Soup Co. for 2019-2020 starting with the historical statements for 2016-2018. For your forecast use the assumptions given in the worksheet entitled \"Forecast Assumptions,\" but make your model flexible enough so that a user can easily play \"what if\" games. (40 points)  Be sure to enter the forecast factors in the space provided in column G. As indicated in the assumptions, hold the levels of both short-term and long-term debts constant. This will result in an unbalanced balance sheet. Show the difference as the discretionary funding needed (DFN) in row 74. Calculate the pro forma EPS and DPS in rows 31 and 32. You should have forecasts for both the income statement and balance sheet Format all of the pro forma numbers so that they match the formatting of the corresponding historical numbers.   Balanced Pro Forma Statements (Pro Forma Balanced). We saw with the previous pro forma model that most of the time projected balance sheets will be out of balance and will indicate a need for discretionary financing. Modify the model so that it will automatically balance the balance sheet based on the following requirements. (10 points)  Ensure that Excel's iterative calculation is turned on! Create a copy of the \"Historical & Pro Forma\" worksheet and name it \"Pro Forma Balanced.\" Use short-term debt (STD) as the plug to balance the entire balance sheet. What you should observe is that for one or more years, STD becomes negative.   Pro Forma 1. Now, modify the balance sheet in the previous model so that Cash & Marketable Securities (C&MS) maintains a minimum $250 (million) balance and that any cash in excess of this is used to pay off STD, and if all STD is paid off, then excess cash is deposited in the C&MS account. (15 points)  Create a copy of the \"Pro Forma Balanced\" worksheet and name it \"Pro Forma 1\" to complete this requirement.   Financial Statement Sensitivity Analysis (Sensitivity). First, make a copy of the \"Pro Forma 1\" worksheet and name it \"Sensitivity.\"  Your management wants to see how Net Income, EPS, and dividends per share (DPS) will change for 2020 for sales growth rates from 1% to 10% (changing by 1% each time) per year over 2019 and 2020. Create a one-input data table to show this information. (10 points)   Be sure to format this table so that it is easy to read. Make use of borders and shading. Also be sure to label the columns for Net Income, EPS and DPS. The table should look similar to what we completed in class. Ensure that the numbers produced are formatted using the Currency number format.   Second, create a two-input data table to show how EBIT for 2020 will depend on the cost of goods sold-to-sales ratio and sales growth rate in a reasonable range. (10 points)  Use the sales growth rates from the sensitivity table you just created. For the cost of goods sold-to-sales ratio, use 53% to 57%.        Once you have completed your quiz, upload your completed Excel file to this question.

      "Read the following- Academic Honesty: All work that you submit in the course must be your own. This includes all of your assignments, quizzes, and exams. Using apps or having someone else do your work is considered cheating. Be sure your grade is a reflection of the work you did in this course so you feel good about all the things you learned. Students are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors. To incorporate the words or ideas of another without giving credit to the source or to cheat on an examination corrupts the essential process by which knowledge is advanced. Refer to the Student Handbook for more details and potential consequences for engaging in academic dishonesty. All acts of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Vice President of Student Success, per the LCC Student Handbook. Any student caught cheating or assisting a student to cheat will receive a grade of F (0%) for that exam. A second offense will result in a failing grade for the entire course.   Using a cell phone for any reason during an exam will be considered cheating.  Failure to follow the proctoring (Honorlock)  rules will be considered cheating.      If the Honorlock video shows a cheating incident, a retake will only earn a maximum of 73%.    Answer the following- Using apps, having someone do your work, and using a cell phone or notes on a test are all examples of cheating. A student caught cheating will get a zero on that exam.

      "Use your own materials to do the following: For this practical, you will use an ATxmega128A1U microcontroller to create continuously running asynchronous serial (SCI) to synchronous serial (SPI) converter, as well as output a voltage based on the serial value. For the entirety of this problem, use the default system clock of 2 MHz. No backpacks are needed for this assignment.  Use the appropriate USART on your uPAD with a baud rate of 47 kHz, eight data bits, even parity, and one stop bit. Each time a character is received, immediately transmit that character using SPI. You must use appropriate group configurations, bit positions, and/or bit masks and not use numbers. Use the appropriate SPI on your uPAD such that [1] a serial clock frequency 125 kHz is utilized (remember that the system clock frequency is 2 MHz), [2] data transmitted will be arranged in a least significant bit first ordering, [3] (except for the first bit) transmission of bits will occur on a rising edge of the serial clock (the opposite edge of when data is sampled), [4] the default value of the serial clock, when not in use, will be zero (low). In order to use your DAD, connect Select (in Figure 1b and 1c) to high (3.3 V). If the data received with the USART and transmitted value is 100 = 0x64 or less, output 0.5 V on the DAC; if it is higher, output 1 V on the DAC. For testing purposes, note that numbers and upper case letters (A-Z) and lower case letters a-d will result in values less than or equal to 100 (with 'd' = 100) and lower case letters between e and z will result in values greater than 100. Continue to hold the DAC output value until another character is received. Prior to demonstration, you must zip your entire project (including all utilized files) and then upload the zip file to the Canvas Quiz. If you have not demonstrated prior to 5 minutes before the end of your exam time, you must stop at that point and start the zip and upload process, and complete this process before your time expires. Failure to upload your project's zip file before then will result in a grade of zero.  Demonstrate the following to a PI or Dr. Schwartz:  Use PuTTY to allow characters typed on your computer keyboard to be received by your uPAD. Show that the byte has been received (with a breakpoint and Watch debug window or by transmitting the received data back to your PC monitor through PuTTY). Before you connect with PuTTY, show the PI your settings. [25%] Use your DAD (as you did in Lab 6) to show that the SPI system has transmitted the data as specified. View all appropriate SPI signals with the SPI digital bus analyzer function of the Logic program within the Waveforms software (see the left image of Figure 1). [25%]  Suggestion: Set a trigger on the appropriate edge of the clock signal. Remember that the clock is low when idle and that the transmission of bits will occur on the clock's rising edge.   Combine the above two items to create the SCI to SPI converter. [25%] Use the Scope function within the Waveforms software to display the value generated with the DAC. If the received serial value is 100 = 0x64 or less, output 0.5 V on the DAC; if it is higher, output 1 V on the DAC. For testing purposes, note that numbers and upper case letters  will result in values less than 100 and low case letters between e and z will result in values greater than 100. [25%] Prior to demonstration, you must zip your entire project (including all utilized files) and then upload the zip file to the Canvas Quiz. If you have not demonstrated prior to 5 minutes before the end of your exam time, you must stop at that point and start the zip and upload process, and complete this process before your time expires. Failure to upload your project's zip file before then will result in a grade of zero.   Figure 1: a) Adding an SPI bus within the Logic program; b) necessary SPI settings; c) set the appropriate Clock trigger (column T); d) Clock trigger choices.   When you are finished or five minutes before the end of this practical (whichever comes first), you must zip your Atmel Studio project. Failure to upload your zip file (BELOW) before the end of the practical will result in a grade of zero.   After submitting the assignment, close Honorlock, but do NOT close Zoom.

      "Use your own materials to do the following: For this practical, you will use an ATxmega128A1U microcontroller to create continuously running asynchronous serial (SCI) to synchronous serial (SPI) converter, as well as output a voltage based on the serial value. For the entirety of this problem, use the default system clock of 2 MHz. No backpacks are needed for this assignment.  Use the appropriate USART on your uPAD with a baud rate of 47 kHz, eight data bits, even parity, and one stop bit. Each time a character is received, immediately transmit that character using SPI. You must use appropriate group configurations, bit positions, and/or bit masks and not use numbers. Use the appropriate SPI on your uPAD such that [1] a serial clock frequency 125 kHz is utilized (remember that the system clock frequency is 2 MHz), [2] data transmitted will be arranged in a least significant bit first ordering, [3] (except for the first bit) transmission of bits will occur on a rising edge of the serial clock (the opposite edge of when data is sampled), [4] the default value of the serial clock, when not in use, will be zero (low). In order to use your DAD, connect Select (in Figure 1b and 1c) to high (3.3 V). If the received with the USART and transmitted value is 100 = 0x64 or less, output 0.5 V on the DAC; if it is higher, output 1 V on the DAC. For testing purposes, note that numbers and upper case letters (A-Z) and lower case letters a-d will result in values less than or equal to 100 (with 'd' = 100) and lower case letters between e and z will result in values greater than 100. Continue to hold the DAC output value until another character is received. Prior to demonstration, you must zip your entire project (including all utilized files) and then upload the zip file to the Canvas Quiz. If you have not demonstrated prior to 5 minutes before the end of your exam time, you must stop at that point and start the zip and upload process, and complete this process before your time expires. Failure to upload your project's zip file before then will result in a grade of zero.  Demonstrate the following to a PI or Dr. Schwartz:  Use PuTTY to allow characters typed on your computer keyboard to be received by your uPAD. Show that the byte has been received (with a breakpoint and Watch debug window or by transmitting the received data back to your PC monitor through PuTTY).

In order to fulfill this purpose, an environment of integrity, dependability and honesty must be maintained by all members of the York College community. Without a foundation based on intellectual honesty and integrity, the very ability to uphold the academic endeavors that York College strives to pursue is inhibited. The Spartan Oath embodies the expectation that all members of the York College community foster an environment of integrity and responsibility. Recognize that adhering to an ethical standard of honesty leads to professional, mature and responsible citizens, and enables society at large to trust our scholarship, research, and conferred degrees. Thus, each member of the York College community must be truthful, honest, personally and professionally responsible, and respect the intellectual contributions of others. Definition of Academic Dishonesty Engaging in academic dishonesty is a violation of the school's academic integrity policy and is not tolerated at York College. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarism (i.e. passing someone else's words or ideas off as one's own without proper attribution), improper paraphrasing, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, handing in material completed for another course, and submitting work not done independently (unless part of an explicitly collaborative project) (YCP 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog).
